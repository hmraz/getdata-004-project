CodeBook describing variables used (and produced by) run_analysis.R
---

variables found in `final` dataframe:

`activity`: textual description of activity being performed by `subject` when measurements were recorded

`subject` : unique, anonymous ID of each subject being observed

The remaining are named according the measurement type, axis of measurement, and whether the measure is a mean or standard deviation.

variables found in `final_avg` dataframe are the same, except the numbers represent averages of each measurement.
